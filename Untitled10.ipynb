      "</svg><span itemprop=\"reviewBody\">Lovely hotel close to Darling Harbour, ferries, train station etc.  Perfect location for those wanting to be close to Darling Harbour but away from  noise.  Right from entering the lobby the hotel had a very quiet and peaceful vibe.   Smaller but perfectly appointed room with everything that you needed. Our room was so quiet and had the most comfortable bed and pillows.  The staff were all super friendly and nothing was too much trouble.  Was perfect for our long weekend getaway and we would definately be back to stay here again.</span></p>\n",

Right from entering the lobby the hotel had a very quiet and peaceful vibe.   Smaller but perfectly appointed room with everything that you needed. Our room was so quiet and had the most comfortable bed and pillows.  The staff were all super friendly and nothing was too much trouble.  Was perfect for our long weekend getaway and we would definately be back to stay here again.</span></p>\n",
